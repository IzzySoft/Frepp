   "NonFreeDep" : "The application depends on a non-free application (e.g. Google Maps) - i.e. it requires it to be installed on the device, but does not include it.",
   "Ads" : "The application contains advertising.",
   "ApplicationDebuggable" : "APK files of this application are compiled for debugging („application-debuggable“). For details, see e.g. <a href=\"http://android.stackexchange.com/q/140468/16575\">What are the security implications of using an app built “for debug”</a>.",
   "NonFreeAdd" : "The application promotes non-free add-ons, such that the app is effectively an advert for other non-free software and such software is not clearly labelled as such.",
   "Tracking" : "The application tracks and reports your activity to somewhere either without your consent, or by default (i.e. you’d have to actively disable it). It’s commonly used for when developers obtain crash logs without the user’s consent, or when an app is useless without some kind of authentication.",

   "DisabledAlgorithm": "This APK was signed using a signature algorithm that was disabled because it is broken.",
   "KnownVuln": "This APK has a known security vulnerability, found by one of the scanners in _fdroidserver_. The most common case is a broken signature algorithm or using a vulnerable version of OpenSSL.",
   "NoSourceSince": "Upstream source for this app is no longer available. Either the app went commercial, the repo was dropped, or it has moved to a location currently unknown to us. This usual means there won't be further updates unless the source reappears."
