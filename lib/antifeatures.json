   "NonFreeDep" : "The application depends on a non-free application (e.g. Google Maps) - i.e. it requires it to be installed on the device, but does not include it.",
   "Ads" : "The application contains advertising.",
   "NonFreeAdd" : "The application promotes non-free add-ons, such that the app is effectively an advert for other non-free software and such software is not clearly labelled as such.",
   "Tracking" : "The application tracks and reports your activity to somewhere either without your consent, or by default (i.e. you’d have to actively disable it). It’s commonly used for when developers obtain crash logs without the user’s consent, or when an app is useless without some kind of authentication.",
   "NonFreeNet" : "This application promotes a non-Free network service.",
   "NonFreeAssets" : "The application contains and makes use of non-free assets. The most common case is apps using artwork - images, sounds, music, etc - under a non-commercial license.",
   "UpstreamNonFree" : "The application is or depends on non-free software. This does not mean that non-free software is included with the app: Most likely, it has been patched in some way to remove the non-free code. However, functionality may be missing."
