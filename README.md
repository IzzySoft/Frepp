## PHP Repo Parser for F-Droid
This repo contains a PHP class to parse and use the `index.xml` files of a local
F-Droid repository. It is still in its early stage, so not much documentation
for now. Feel free to use it with your own projects as long as the license fits.

### License
This project uses the GPLv2 license as stated in the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file.
